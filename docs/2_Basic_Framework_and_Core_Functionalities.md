# Project Phase 2 - Basic Structure and Main Functionalities

## 1. Environment

The project operates within a **cloud-native architecture**, leveraging infrastructure that ensures **high availability, fault tolerance, scalability**, and **security**.

### Key Environment Features:
- **Cloud Hosting Platform**: The application is hosted on a managed cloud service such as **AWS**, **Azure**, or **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, supporting both vertical and horizontal scaling.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build, test, and deployment processes are configured via **GitHub Actions** (or other tools like Jenkins/GitLab CI) to streamline delivery and reduce manual overhead.
- **Containerization**: The full stack is containerized using **Docker**, enabling consistency across development, staging, and production environments. Future scalability with **Kubernetes (K8s)** is considered.
- **Source Control**: **GitHub** is used for version control, collaboration, and code review processes, utilizing a Git branching strategy.
- **Monitoring and Observability**:
  - **Monitoring**: Implemented using **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for real-time metrics tracking.
  - **Logging**: Centralized logging with **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or **Cloud-native logging (e.g., AWS CloudWatch or GCP Stackdriver)** for diagnostics and auditing.
- **Security and Compliance**: Environment configurations include encrypted environment variables, HTTPS enforcement, and role-based access to services.

This robust environment setup lays the groundwork for seamless scaling and enterprise-grade reliability.
