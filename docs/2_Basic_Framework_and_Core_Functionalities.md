# Project Phase 2 - Basic Structure and Main Functionalities

## 1. Environment

The project operates within a **cloud-native architecture**, leveraging infrastructure that ensures **high availability, fault tolerance, scalability**, and **security**.

### Key Environment Features:
- **Cloud Hosting Platform**: The application is hosted on a managed cloud service such as **AWS**, **Azure**, or **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, supporting both vertical and horizontal scaling.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build, test, and deployment processes are configured via **GitHub Actions** (or other tools like Jenkins/GitLab CI) to streamline delivery and reduce manual overhead.
- **Containerization**: The full stack is containerized using **Docker**, enabling consistency across development, staging, and production environments. Future scalability with **Kubernetes (K8s)** is considered.
- **Source Control**: **GitHub** is used for version control, collaboration, and code review processes, utilizing a Git branching strategy.
- **Monitoring and Observability**:
  - **Monitoring**: Implemented using **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for real-time metrics tracking.
  - **Logging**: Centralized logging with **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or **Cloud-native logging (e.g., AWS CloudWatch or GCP Stackdriver)** for diagnostics and auditing.
- **Security and Compliance**: Environment configurations include encrypted environment variables, HTTPS enforcement, and role-based access to services.

This robust environment setup lays the groundwork for seamless scaling and enterprise-grade reliability.

## 2️⃣ Backend

The backend is developed with **Node.js + Express.js**, enabling fast, non-blocking operations.

### 🔧 Features:
- **🔐 Authentication & Security**:
  - JWT-based auth
  - OAuth 2.0 (planned)
  - Role-based access control
- **🔗 RESTful API Endpoints**: Modular, REST-compliant services.
- **🔨 Microservices Architecture**: Feature-based services (e.g., users, drivers, reports).
- **⚡ Performance Optimization**:
  - Caching via **Redis**
  - Indexed queries in PostgreSQL
  - Async request handling

📎 _See the backend folder structure: `backend/src`_  
📄 _API docs available in:_ [`docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md`](../docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md)

## 3. Frontend
The frontend is developed using **React.js** with **Material UI**, ensuring a modern and user-friendly interface. Features include:
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Modular and reusable UI components for maintainability
- **State Management:** Redux for efficient state handling across the application
- **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- **Dynamic Interactivity:** Real-time updates using WebSockets

## 4️⃣ Database

The app uses **PostgreSQL** as the RDBMS with a strong schema architecture.

### 🧠 Highlights:
- **✅ Data Integrity**: Entity relationships enforced via foreign keys
- **🔍 Optimized Queries**: Use of indexes and query plans
- **📈 Scalability**: Partitioned tables and horizontal scaling support
- **🛡️ Backup & Recovery**: Cron-based daily backups and replication enabled

📄 _SQL schema files:_ `database/schema.sql`, `database/seed.sql`

## 5. Basic Structure and Architecture
The application follows a **three-tier architecture**, consisting of:
1. **Presentation Layer:** The React.js frontend
2. **Business Logic Layer:** The Node.js backend with Express.js
3. **Data Layer:** PostgreSQL database for persistent storage

Additionally, **Microservices and API Gateway** patterns are implemented for modular development and better scalability.

---



### Extended Architecture Patterns

- **Microservices** for modular and scalable service logic  
- **API Gateway** (optional) for routing and authentication  
- **Reverse Proxy (Nginx)** for handling static asset delivery
