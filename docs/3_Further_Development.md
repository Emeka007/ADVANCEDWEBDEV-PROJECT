# 🚀 Phase 3 – Further Development

## 📌 Objective
Phase 3 focuses on **enhancing usability**, **extending functionality**, and **polishing existing modules** based on Phase 1 use cases and Phase 2 implementations. It’s intended to raise the evaluation of the project and demonstrate modular and scalable improvements.

## ✅ Summary of Improvements

### 🧩 Modular Scene Architecture

The frontend has been restructured using a new **`scenes/` directory**. Each folder represents a functional page/component, encapsulating logic, styles, and layout in a scalable way.

| Folder                   | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bar/`                   | Includes visual bar charts for quick delivery metrics using `recharts`.    |
| `bookingg/`              | Main booking UI, including date/time slot selection and confirmation flow. |
| `calendar/`              | Delivery calendar integration using `react-calendar`.                      |
| `dashboard/`             | Main landing/dashboard with summaries (role-specific views).               |

| `geography/`             | Displays delivery location statistics via maps.                            |
| `global/`                | Global state management and contextual tools.                              |

| `performance_metric/`    | New metrics page visualizing delivery and efficiency stats.                |
| `pie/`                   | Pie chart for categorical breakdown of emission sources or deliveries.     |
| `Rating/`                | Component for rating displays and aggregation.                             |
| `settings/`              | Account settings page with editable profile fields.                        |
